detection), improving query routing across 100+ categories via SageMaker.
• Used resampling and confidence intervals to evaluate and improve model confidence on rare query intents,
increasing trust and accuracy for low-frequency categories in Alexa.
• Improved the generated success rate model’s alignment with human-labeled success rate, reducing gap from
~20% to under 14%, enabling reduced annotation spend.
• Built reporting pipelines that pushed KPIs into Redshift and Quicksight to visualize key health metrics and rolling
forecast 3-month trends to support weekly reviews with product stakeholders.
